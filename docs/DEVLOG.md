# Devlog

One entry per working day: what changed, what I learned, what's next.

## Day 1 — 2026-11-01

**Built**
- Provenance oracle: tags + chain hashes; phantom attention/LM head.
- ToyEngine: paged KV, prefix cache (LRU), preemption, PD disaggregation, aborts.
- Deterministic simulator: one seed controls everything; trace + fingerprint.
- CLI: `fuzz`, `replay`. 9 tests.

**Results**
- Correct engine: 0 false positives over 1,000 seeds (~110 seeds/s on CPU).
- Planted `abort-free-race` (SGLang Oct-2026 class): caught in 544/1,000 seeds,
  reported as `cross-request-leak` with a 15-line replay.
- Planted `stale-prefix-cache`: caught in 1,000/1,000 seeds.

**Learned**
- Prefix-cache hits must leave ≥1 token to compute, otherwise the engine would
  write into a shared block.
- The correct abort rule for PD: blocks with in-flight writes can only be freed
  once the last write lands (or is cancelled and acknowledged).

**Next**
- Shrinker: reduce a failing seed's event list to a minimal reproduction.
- Read vLLM v1 `KVCacheManager`, `BlockPool`, and the simulate-forward PR (#47922).
